When Scemer asked Beluga where he lived, Beluga said that he didn't have a house.
Scemer asked if Beluga doesn't have a house, then where does he sleep to which Beluga stated he slept with Scemer's Mother, Scemer got annoyed and now knows he wasted time by asking Beluga that.
Scemer then decided to use hacks to find out where Beluga actually lived.
However, being that Beluga changed his IP address, Scemer tracked his location to Pee Pee Island where his mother actually lives, surprising Scemer.
